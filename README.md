# 📧 Spam Filter Classifier (Model Engineering Project)

This project implements a **Spam vs. Ham SMS classifier** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.  
It is part of the **Model Engineering module** and demonstrates the full pipeline from data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment as a Flask web application.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of SMS messages (tokenization, cleaning, normalization).  
- Vectorization with **TF-IDF**.  
- Classification using a trained ML model.  
- Flask web interface for real-time spam detection.  
- Adjustable classification threshold for flexible decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset
The model was trained and evaluated using the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** by Almeida et al. (2011).
